# Kush Patel's Data Science Portfolio
This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.

## Stand-alone Projects

### Covid-19 Quarantine Emissions Impact Model
Created a chart to vizualize the impact on emissions from reduced mobility due to Covid-19 quarantine in the USA.

### Patient Selection for Diabetes Drug Testing using EHR Data
Built a machine learning model to identify diabetes patients that are likely to be treated with a novel diabetes drug, thereby ensuring effective reach out of the medical representatives to the corresponding physicians.

### Sentiment Analysis of Patient Review of Drugs
Performed NLP Sentiment Analysis using a Random Forest Classifier and AWD-LSTM Deep Learning model to predict the sentiment of online drug reviews to positive, negative, or neutral.
