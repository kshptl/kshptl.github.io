I am a data scientist with a background in the bio/pharmaceutical industry. This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## **Projects**

### [Patient Selection for Diabetes Drug Testing using EHR Data](https://github.com/kshptl/Patient-Selection-for-Diabetes-Drug-Testing-using-EHR-Data)
Built a machine learning model to identify diabetes patients that are likely to be treated with a novel diabetes drug, thereby ensuring effective reach out of the medical representatives to the corresponding physicians. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/kshptl/Patient-Selection-for-Diabetes-Drug-Testing-using-EHR-Data)

### [Sentiment Analysis of Patient Review of Drugs](https://github.com/kshptl/Drug-Review-Sentiment-Analysis)
Performed NLP Sentiment Analysis using a Random Forest Classifier and AWD-LSTM Deep Learning model to predict the sentiment of online drug reviews to positive, negative, or neutral.

### [Pneumonia Detection](https://github.com/kshptl/Pneumonia-Detection)
In this project, data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset was analyzed and trained with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia. This project culminates in a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy.

### [Covid-19 Quarantine Emissions Impact Model](https://github.com/kshptl/covid-19-emissions)
Created a chart to vizualize the impact on emissions from reduced mobility due to Covid-19 quarantine in the USA.

### [Plagarism Checker](https://github.com/kshptl/Plagarism-Checker-Algorithm)
Plagarism Checker using MinHash and Jaccard Similarity in finding similar items.

### [Network and Communities Clustering](https://github.com/kshptl/Network-Communities-and-Clustering)
This project showcases algorithms for network community analysis and clustering. Specifically, the Girvan-Newman community detection algorithm and the k-mediods algorithm.

### [Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis with the EM Algorithm](https://github.com/kshptl/Topic-Modeling)
This project used PLSA with the EM algorithm to determine topics from a corpus of news articles.
